How To Contribute
=================

Ticket Tracker
--------------

For most people, the simplest way to contribute is to use ticket
tracker. Opening new tickets for bugs or feature requests contributing
additional information or insights by commenting on existing tickets
is relatively straight forward.

For those with the technical skill and inclination, contributions in
the form of code submissions associated with specific tickets would be
greatly appreciated (see below for more details).

If you are affiliated with a contributing agency, another important way
that you can contribute is to ensure that your stocking submissions are
as complete and accurate as possible and that any errors or
inconsistencies found in your submission are addressed promptly.  The
output of FSDViz is only as good as the data that goes into them.

Development
------------

See installation and coding conventions for detailed instructions on
setting up your development environment.  All submissions should
indicate which ticket(s) they address and should be accompanied with
appropriate documentation and unit tests.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation, no matter how comprehensive, could always use more
work.  As such, improvements to the documentation are always welcome.
Contributions can come in the form of git pull requests, or e-mail to
one of the core contributors who can incorporate the contribution on
your behalf.

Tutorials
---------

Like documentation, there can never be too many tutorials.  Complete,
worked examples are always welcome.
