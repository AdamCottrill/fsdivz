Ticket Tracker
==============

About Ticket Tracker
--------------------

Ticket tracker is a simple application that has been integrated into
the development version of the Great Lakes Fish stocking data
visualization tool to keep a record of bugs identified and features
requested during the development and testing phases.  Functionally, it
is very similar to the 'Issues' tabs available on some github
repositories.


Filing Tickets
--------------

In order to file tickets, users will need and account and be logged
into the application.  If you need an account, please contact
<someone>.

Before filing a ticket, do a quick search to see if similar tickets
already exist. If so, please provide comments on that ticket and
up-vote it to increase it's priority ranking. If none of the existing
tickets are appropriate, please open a new one, being as precise and
detailed as possible (see suggestions below).  Tickets are too broad
or vague are unlikely to be effective.

Exisiting tickets can be reference via hyperlink by using the
following syntax in the desciption of your ticket: :code:`ticket:<id>`
where :code:`<id>` is the id number of the ticket you wish to create a
link to.


Suggestions for Creating Effective Tickets
``````````````````````````````````````````
- limit the ticket to a single discrete feature or bug.  Tickets that
  involve several features or bugs will have to be split so that each
  can be tracked indepently.  It is possible that details will be lost
  or mis-interpreed during the splitting process.

- do not duplicate exsisting tickets  This just created unnecessary
  clutter.  Comment on existing tickets if possible.

- for feature requests:

  - describe the feature in detail, including the desired behavior

  - links or reference to other tools that have the same or similar
    fashion are helpful

  - provide a summary of how this feature could be integrated into the
    application - how will people find it once it is implemented?
    Should the feature be publicly available or only available for
    certain users? If only certain uses can see it, who are they?

- for bug reports:

  - describe the bug in detail, including a description of the
    expected behavior and how this differs from the current behaviour.

  - provide enough information to make the bug reproducible.  Bugs
    that can't be reproduced by the development team are difficult or
    impossible to fix.
